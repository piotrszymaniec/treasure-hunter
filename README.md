### Treasure Hunter

Update and rewrite of **[initial version](https://github.com/piotrszymaniec/treasure-hunter-js)** which was written in javascript.

Features
- typescript
- model, view approach
- communication between model and view with events

I'd like to add many new elements like:
- loading maps on start
- multiplier
- saving/loading
and more

[demo]

Goal: Practice coding in those tough days when I don't really feel like I want to. :)
